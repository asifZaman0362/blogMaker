!!DISCLAIMER!!:
I know I should stop using design.txt's to engineer software but my god if they aren't efficient. So unless I find any good reason
not to (other than the obvious ones such as hard-to-manage, **unprofessional** and AREYOUFREAKINSERIOUS?), I shall continue
using them to design software that nobody other than myself will ever actually use (And I'm not even sure I myself will
stick with it and not move on to something **wink wink** better). So I don't care and neither should you.

So, yes
A markdown based static blog generator

What we needs:
    * A database of blogs (in case of updates):
        * A blogs directory with every single blog post to ever have lived on the site (archived/deleted posts shall be stored in
          the appropriately named 'archived' folder)
        * A database (.dat file basically) with the unique id's of added blog posts (for udpates and deletions)
        * 'tis all
    * CLI beacuse man not machine
        * simple commands like 'add, update, remove'
        * 'tis all
    * 'tis all

What we dont-needs (or more precisely: what we needs to avoid):
    * scope-creeps
        * This program does just one job (actually three):
            - Add blog posts
            - Update blog posts
            - Remove blog posts
          And all that it does in a simple but elegant manner, using textfiles and markdown
        * This program does not have a blog post editor (use vim, or vscode like a heathen such as myself)
        * This program does not provide backups or anything of that kind
        * This program is NOT a DBMS
        * All you get is three commands: add, update, remove
        * 'tis all
    * 'tis all

Got it? Good!
'tis all
