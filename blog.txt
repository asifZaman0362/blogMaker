The unfortunate death of Sir Ravix Of Fourhorn
Jaskier, the bard
It is with a heavy heart that I inform you all that our beloved knight and friend, the Witcher Geralt of Rivia has passed away on this gloomy night at around 11:30 PM. May his soul rest in piece.
Geralt was a long time friend of mine. We used to go hunting together. I accompanied him in many of his hunts. Some of which changed both our lives forever.
Geralt was a man of honor. He had a heart of gold.
